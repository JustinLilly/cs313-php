      <p>
        I am from Gilbert, Arizona. I come from a rather large family, being the seventh of nine kids. 
        I served in the Philippines Cavite Mission. It was split from the Manila mission and was only six month old by the time I got there.
        Because of said mission, it is my firm belief that the greatest fruit of all time is the mango. If the only mangoes you've ever had are the crap you find in grocery stores and Walmart, then you haven't had real mangoes. Real mangoes freshly plucked off the tree might possibly be sweeter than the fruit of the Tree of Life.
